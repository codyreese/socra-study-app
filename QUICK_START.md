## SOCRA Exam Info

**Note:** The SOCRA CCRP exam is nationwide - there's no different test for Utah vs. other states. It's the same certification recognized everywhere.

**Your current role:** You're running cancer trials at Huntsman, so you already have real-world experience! This test is about formalizing that knowledge and filling in any regulatory/procedural gaps.

## Good Luck!

You're going to do great! Take your time, study consistently, and use all the features in this app. That raise and promotion are waiting for you!

Remember: You already know how to do this job - the exam is just proving it on paper.

**Study every day, even if it's just 30 minutes. Consistency beats cramming!**
